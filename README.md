# **ML Project for Customer Lifetime Value Prediction in Telecom**

CLTV analysis enables companies to identify high-value customers, develop personalized retention strategies, and allocate marketing resources accordingly. It also helps companies optimize their sales and pricing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce churn rate.

In this project, we will be exploring different CLTV calculation methods, and analyzing feature importance to determine the most influential factors on CLTV.

We will also be identifying high-value customers based on their CLTV scores, analyzing their characteristics and behavior, and providing suggestions for targeted marketing and retention strategies.
